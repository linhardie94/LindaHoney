# LindaHoney Website
Hyperion Dev L1T15 â€“ my first website for a food business that delivers homemade meals using html, css and javascript.

## Table of contents
Inside the task 15 folder you will find:
1. fonts folder
2. images folder
3. src folder containing js code
4. html code for my index page, cart page, shop page and product pages.
5. a compressed folder that I used to submit my task

## Installation 
To install this project locally:
1. Go to the "< > Code" tab of this project
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select "Download ZIP" 
A zip file will download to your computor and your will be able to start working on the project locally. 

## Usage
When using these files there are a few things to keep in mind. 

The first is the naming and file structure. Be careful when changing names and moving files around because it may break some objects across the webpage that you may not expect. 

The seceond thing to look out for is the way products in the catalogue were created. I used javascript objects and an array to create the product catalogue. I used that same catalogue across multiple pages (the index and the catalogue page) and referred back to the catalogue structure in my cart page and in my navbar. So when creating new products, editing the navbar and the cart page, you need to give extra care, because so much logic is tied into creating a product in javascript. 

Here is a screenshot of the js code for how I generate a cart item and another screenshot of how I use the generateCartItem code later in my discount funtion to show you what I mean:


Everything else is fairly straightforward. Go wild and please share suggestions about how I can improve my code efficiency.
